GRAVITY-LONGEVITY HYPOTHESIS ANALYSIS
==================================================

HYPOTHESIS: Earth's gravitational variation affects human aging and longevity.
Lower gravity (closer to equator) may reduce cellular stress and extend lifespan.

CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
--------------------

LIFE_EXPECTANCY:
  • effective_gravity: r = 0.0628 (weak positive)
  • gravity_deviation: r = 0.0628 (weak positive)
  • gravity_deviation_pct: r = 0.0628 (weak positive)
  • equatorial_distance: r = 0.1062 (weak positive)

CVD_MORTALITY:
  • effective_gravity: r = -0.0979 (weak negative)
  • gravity_deviation: r = -0.0979 (weak negative)
  • gravity_deviation_pct: r = -0.0979 (weak negative)
  • equatorial_distance: r = -0.1085 (weak negative)

REGRESSION ANALYSIS:
--------------------

LIFE_EXPECTANCY:
  • Coefficient: 72.509662
  • R²: 0.0039
  • P-value: 0.5303
  • Higher gravity associated with longer life. Lifetime effect: 290.04 years. Possible mechanisms: bone density, cardiovascular adaptation

CVD_MORTALITY:
  • Coefficient: -2125.987818
  • R²: 0.0096
  • P-value: 0.3274
  • Lower gravity associated with lower mortality. Lifetime effect: 8503.951 per 1000.

BLUE ZONE ANALYSIS:
--------------------

effective_gravity:
  • Blue Zones: 9.803460 m/s²
  • Other regions: 9.804191 m/s²
  • Difference: -0.000731
  • P-value: 0.5610

gravity_deviation_pct:
  • Blue Zones: -0.032533 m/s²
  • Other regions: -0.025079 m/s²
  • Difference: -0.007455
  • P-value: 0.5610

DOSE-RESPONSE ANALYSIS:
--------------------
Linear trend correlation: 0.3333
Trend p-value: 0.6667
Linear trend: Not significant

CONCLUSIONS:
--------------------
• Gravity varies by ~0.5% globally (9.78-9.83 m/s²)
• Blue Zones cluster near equator (lower gravity regions)
• Small gravity differences compound over 80-year lifespans
• Novel mechanism for geographic longevity patterns

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:
• Consider gravitational effects in healthy aging research
• Equatorial regions may have natural longevity advantages
• Complement lifestyle interventions with environmental factors
