# Model Optimization Notebook - Analysis Summary

## Current State Issues and Recommendations

### 1. **Prediction Tool Issue (Critical)**

**Problem:** The life expectancy prediction tool shows uniform predictions (62.3 years) across all development scenarios.

**Root Cause:** 
- The model is trained on features like `cvd_mortality`, `gravity_deviation`, `temperature_mean`, etc.
- The test scenarios provide different features: `gdp_per_capita`, `health_exp_per_capita`, `urban_pop_pct`
- Since none of the test features are in the model, all inputs default to 0 (scaled mean), resulting in identical predictions

**Fix Required:**
```python
# Either:
# Option 1: Use the actual model features in test scenarios
test_scenarios = {
    'High Development': {
        'cvd_mortality': 100,  # Lower mortality
        'temperature_mean': 15,
        'elevation': 200,
        # ... other actual model features
    }
}

# Option 2: Retrain model with economic/health features included
model_features = ['gdp_per_capita', 'health_exp_per_capita', 'cvd_mortality', ...]
```

### 2. **Actionable Insights Issue**

**Current Output:** "No clearly actionable features found in top correlations"

**Problem:** The top correlations are dominated by non-actionable geographic/environmental features (gravity, temperature, elevation).

**Recommendation:** 
- Extend the analysis to examine more features beyond the top 10
- Create a separate analysis specifically for policy-relevant features
- Add a section analyzing correlations of actionable features regardless of their ranking

### 3. **Summary Text Updates Needed**

The summary claims to have found actionable insights and categorized features by policy actionability, but the actual outputs show:
- No actionable features identified
- Only geographic/climate factors with weak correlations

**Updated Summary Should State:**
```markdown
4. **Actionable Insights**: Analysis revealed that top correlations are dominated by 
   non-modifiable geographic and environmental factors. Policy-actionable features 
   (healthcare, economic) show weaker direct correlations with longevity.
```

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Feature Analysis
```python
def analyze_all_feature_categories(df, target='life_expectancy'):
    """Analyze correlations grouped by actionability"""
    
    actionable_features = [
        'gdp_per_capita', 'health_exp_per_capita', 'physicians_per_1000',
        'hospital_beds_per_1000', 'education_index', 'urban_pop_pct'
    ]
    
    non_actionable_features = [
        'effective_gravity', 'temperature_mean', 'elevation',
        'latitude', 'longitude', 'precipitation'
    ]
    
    # Analyze each category separately
    actionable_corrs = df[actionable_features + [target]].corr()[target].drop(target)
    non_actionable_corrs = df[non_actionable_features + [target]].corr()[target].drop(target)
    
    return actionable_corrs, non_actionable_corrs
```

### 2. Fixed Prediction Tool
```python
def create_comprehensive_prediction_tool(df):
    """Create a prediction tool using all relevant features"""
    
    # Include both types of features
    all_features = [
        # Non-modifiable (for baseline prediction)
        'effective_gravity', 'temperature_mean', 'elevation',
        # Modifiable (for policy scenarios)
        'gdp_per_capita', 'health_exp_per_capita', 
        'physicians_per_1000', 'urban_pop_pct'
    ]
    
    # Train model with all features
    X = df[all_features].fillna(df[all_features].median())
    y = df['life_expectancy']
    
    # ... continue with model training
```

### 3. Additional Visualizations

Add these analyses to enhance insights:

1. **Prediction Error Distribution**
```python
residuals = y_test - predictions
plt.hist(residuals, bins=30)
plt.xlabel('Prediction Error (years)')
plt.title('Model Prediction Error Distribution')
```

2. **Feature Interaction Heatmap**
```python
# Show interactions between actionable and non-actionable features
interaction_matrix = df[selected_features].corr()
sns.heatmap(interaction_matrix, cmap='coolwarm', center=0)
```

3. **Policy Scenario Analysis**
```python
def policy_scenario_analysis(model, baseline_features):
    """Show impact of improving actionable features"""
    scenarios = {
        'Baseline': baseline_features,
        '+10% Healthcare Spending': {**baseline_features, 'health_exp_per_capita': baseline_features['health_exp_per_capita'] * 1.1},
        '+1 Physician/1000': {**baseline_features, 'physicians_per_1000': baseline_features['physicians_per_1000'] + 1}
    }
    
    for name, features in scenarios.items():
        prediction = model.predict(features)
        print(f"{name}: {prediction:.1f} years")
```

## Key Findings (Corrected)

1. **Geographic Dominance**: The strongest predictors of longevity are non-modifiable geographic and environmental factors
2. **Weak Policy Levers**: Traditional policy interventions (healthcare spending, education) show weaker direct correlations
3. **Model Performance**: Random Forest achieves best performance but relies heavily on geographic features
4. **Regional Patterns**: Blue Zone scoring successfully identifies high-longevity regions but criteria are geography-biased

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fixes**:
   - Fix prediction tool to use correct features
   - Update summary text to match actual findings
   - Add missing features to model training

2. **Enhanced Analysis**:
   - Separate correlation analysis by feature category
   - Add confidence intervals to predictions
   - Include interaction effects analysis
   - Add temporal trend analysis if data available

3. **Documentation**:
   - Clearly document which features are actionable vs non-actionable
   - Provide interpretation guidelines for policy makers
   - Include limitations section

## Code Fix for Prediction Tool

```python
# Quick fix for the prediction tool
def create_working_prediction_tool(model, scaler, features, df):
    """Fixed version with proper feature mapping"""
    
    # Get actual feature medians for defaults
    feature_defaults = df[features].median().to_dict()
    
    def predict_life_expectancy(**kwargs):
        # Map common inputs to model features if needed
        feature_mapping = {
            'gdp_per_capita': 'gdp_per_capita_scaled',  # if scaled version exists
            'health_exp_per_capita': 'health_expenditure',  # if different name
            # Add other mappings as needed
        }
        
        input_vector = []
        for feature in features:
            # Check mapped names first
            mapped_value = None
            for input_key, model_key in feature_mapping.items():
                if input_key in kwargs and model_key == feature:
                    mapped_value = kwargs[input_key]
                    break
            
            if mapped_value is not None:
                input_vector.append(mapped_value)
            elif feature in kwargs:
                input_vector.append(kwargs[feature])
            else:
                # Use actual median instead of 0
                input_vector.append(feature_defaults.get(feature, 0))
        
        # Continue with prediction...
        return model.predict(scaler.transform([input_vector]))[0]
    
    return predict_life_expectancy
```

## Conclusion

The notebook provides valuable analysis but needs corrections to:
1. Align the prediction tool with the actual model features
2. Accurately represent the finding that actionable features have weak correlations
3. Add additional analyses to extract policy-relevant insights despite geographic dominance

These fixes will make the analysis more accurate and useful for decision-makers.
